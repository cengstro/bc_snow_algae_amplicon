abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {One of the most abundant algal species found in snow on the South Orkney Islands is a unicellular chrysophycean not hitherto reported from this region. Investigations both by direct counts and by in situ determinations of metabolic activity by a radiocarbon technique suggest that growth of snow algae is, in general, slow. Their primary productivity is estimated as being of the order of 10 mg carbon fixed m-2 snow surface day-1. The sudden appearance of patches of these algae seems to be due to mechanical accumulation at the surface, as ablation of the snow proceeds, of cells previously distributed sparsely through its thickness. There appear to be no great differences either in species composition or in metabolic activity between green, yellow and red snow. The greater population densities and absence of red resting spores characteristic of green snow are perhaps attributable to greater availability of liquid water.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved 1751-7362/17. Rare species are increasingly recognized as crucial, yet vulnerable components of Earth's ecosystems. This is also true for microbial communities, which are typically composed of a high number of relatively rare species. Recent studies have demonstrated that rare species can have an over-proportional role in biogeochemical cycles and may be a hidden driver of microbiome function. In this review, we provide an ecological overview of the rare microbial biosphere, including causes of rarity and the impacts of rare species on ecosystem functioning. We discuss how rare species can have a preponderant role for local biodiversity and species turnover with rarity potentially bound to phylogenetically conserved features. Rare microbes may therefore be overlooked keystone species regulating the functioning of host-associated, terrestrial and aquatic environments. We conclude this review with recommendations to guide scientists interested in investigating this rapidly emerging research area.},

abstract = {Abstract This is the first report in the literature of snow algae found extensively in an arid region. In the American Southwest, species distribution was related mostly to exposure. Chloromonas nivalis was the dominant species found in thirty-one of thirty-four collecting areas containing snow algae. It caused green to orange colouration of snow in mostly shaded regions of the forests. Cryocystis granulosa cell type was most prevalent in the southwestern portion of the study area. It caused orange to orange-red colouration of snow near tree canopies and usually received more irradiation than populations of Chloromonas nivalis. Carteria nivale – Scotiella polyptera cell types dominated in each of the six collecting areas where they were found in shaded regions in the eastern portion of the study. These cell types caused green colouration, usually in horizontal bands up to 25 cm below the surface in residual snowbanks.

abstract = {The large amount of DNA sequence data generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies often allows multiple samples to be sequenced in parallel on a single sequencing run. This is particularly true if subsets of the genome are studied rather than complete genomes. In recent years, target capture from sequencing libraries has largely replaced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the preferred method of target enrichment. Parallelizing target capture and sequencing for multiple samples requires the incorporation of sample-specific barcodes into sequencing libraries, which is necessary to trace back the sample source of each sequence. This protocol describes a fast and reliable method for the preparation of barcoded ("indexed") sequencing libraries for Illumina's Genome Analyzer platform. The protocol avoids expensive commercial library preparation kits and can be performed in a 96-well plate setup using multi-channel pipettes, requiring not more than two or three days of lab work. Libraries can be prepared from any type of double-stranded DNA, even if present in subnanogram quantity.},

abstract = {The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a classical reference organism for photosynthesis, chloroplast biology, cell cycle control, and cilia structure and function. It is also an emerging model for sensory cilia, production of high-value bioproducts and in situ structure determination. Much of the early appeal of Chlamydomonas was rooted in its promise as a genetic system, but like other classic model systems this rise to prominence predated the discovery of the structure of DNA, whole genome sequences, and molecular techniques to manipulate genes. Its haploid genome facilitates genetic analyses, and offers many of the advantages of a microbial system to study photosynthetic organisms. C. reinhardtii has contributed to our understanding of chloroplast-based photosynthesis and cilia biology. Despite pervasive transgene silencing, technological advances have allowed researchers to address outstanding lines of inquiry in algal research. The most thoroughly-studied unicellular alga, C. reinhardtii is the current standard for algal research, and although it lacks routine genome editing, it nevertheless delivers the template for other algae. Here, we present a historical retrospective of C. reinhardtii's rise to shine a light on its past and present, and present resources for current and future scientists who may wish to expand to the realm of microalgae.},

abstract = {Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2{\%} and 87.1{\%} of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7{\%} and 47.1{\%} of the DNA alignments and 42.2{\%} and 100{\%} of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3-97.1{\%}. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.},

abstract = {Declining mountain snowpack and earlier snowmelt across the western United States has implications for downstream communities. We present a possible mechanism linking snowmelt rate and streamflow generation using a gridded implementation of the Budyko framework. We computed an ensemble of Budyko streamflow anomalies (BSAs) using Variable Infiltration Capacity model-simulated evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, and estimated precipitation at 1/16° resolution from 1950 to 2013. BSA was correlated with simulated baseflow efficiency (r2=0.64) and simulated snowmelt rate (r2=0.42). The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r2=0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow. Rapid snowmelt may thus bring the soil to field capacity, facilitating below-root zone percolation, streamflow, and a positive BSA. Previous works have shown that future increases in regional air temperature may lead to earlier, slower snowmelt and hence decreased streamflow production via the mechanism proposed by this work. 1.},

However, experimental designs to investigate this issue are manifold and the target organisms are extremely diverse. Data are included from the prokaryotic cyanobacteria, haptophytes, diatoms, brown algae to green algae (fresh water, snow algae and marine species) including different habitats from marine littoral and open ocean to freshwater ponds, lakes and snow fields. A broad overview on UV effects on algae is given, with a focus on structurally visible changes. Here we report on destruction in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and the occurrence of structures that are likely to be related to the UV stress. In addition several new data are presented from organisms that have to face naturally high UV irradiation due to their habitats. As no disturbances are reported in these organisms, they obviously have a set of protective mechanisms allowing survival in extreme habitats such as snow fields. Physiological changes as a consequence of UV irradiation are included, effects on the DNA level are summarized, and avoidance strategies are discussed. Every effort has been made to summarize the diverse observations and critically evaluate and compare the different experimental strategies to study UV effects in algae.},

These snow algae do not occur in isolation; rather, visible algal blooms consist of multispecies communities. Although several of these common snow algae have been characterized taxonomically, their inter- and intraspecific diversity remains unknown. Further, the phylogeographic and biogeographic structuring of snow algal species is poorly understood.Methodology.?Algal communities were censused by sequencing the variable internal transcribed spacer 2 locus using Illumina MiSeq. We further analyzed two of the most common and abundant algal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for biogeographic haplotype diversity.Pivotal results.?Our data show that the communities are diverse and taxonomically broad (orders: Chlamydomonadales [74{\%} of OTUs], Microthamniales [20{\%} OTUs], and Chlorellales [6{\%} OTUs]). We demonstrate that the two most common species (best nucleotide basic local alignment search tool match to Coenochloris sp. and Chlamydomonas sp.) have distinct haplotype distributions locally and regionally. Each sampled algal colony was dominated by one and only one haplotype, with negligible intraspecific haplotype diversity.Conclusions.?Our results suggest that snow algae are communities of clones within a discrete patch yet are heterogeneous across the landscape. Thus, these communities are likely structured via strong priority effects, intense kin competition, and dispersal limitations.},

abstract = {Aplanospores of Chlamydomonas nivalis are frequently found in high-altitude, persistent snowfields where they are photosynthetically active despite cold temperatures and high levels of visible and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The goals of this work were to characterize the UV environment of the cells in the snow and to investigate the existence and localization of screening compounds that might prevent UV damage. UV irradiance decreased precipitously in snow, with UV radiation of wavelengths 280-315 nm and UV radiation of wavelengths 315-400 nm dropping to 50{\%} of incident levels in the top 1 and 2 cm, respectively. Isolated cell walls exhibited UV absorbance, possibly by sporopollenin, but this absorbance was weak in images of broken or plasmolyzed cells observed through a UV microscope. The cells also contained UV-absorbing cytoplasmic compounds, with the extrachloroplastic carotenoid astaxanthin providing most of the screening. Additional screening compound(s) soluble in aqueous methanol with an absorption maximum at 335 nm played a minor role. Thus, cells are protected against potentially high levels of UV radiation by the snow itself when they live several centimeters beneath the surface, and they rely on cellular screening compounds, chiefly astaxanthin, when located near the surface where UV fluxes are high.},

abstract = {Chloromonas brevispina and C. nivalis (Volvocales, Chlorophyceae) are considered cosmopolitan, as the aplanozygotes assignable to the two species are distributed worldwide. Although recent phylogenetic analyses have indicated the possible polyphyly of aplanozygotes identified as C. nivalis, the analytical resolution was not robust, possibly because only single genes were analysed. Here, we obtained long sequences of multiple DNA regions from 50 identical [on the basis of light microscopy (LM)] aplanozygotes in a field-collected sample, and the phylogenetic positions of these aplanozygotes (identified as C. brevispina and C. nivalis on the basis of LM) were determined with high statistical support using a multigene phylogeny. Comparisons of the present and previously published sequence data indicated that aplanozygotes of C. nivalis originating from Japan and Austria represented at least four different lineages, all of which were robustly separated from the North American strain CU563D of C. nivalis. Molecular analyses including the comparison of highly evolving nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 demonstrated that one Japanese lineage of C. nivalis aplanozygotes was conspecific with C. miwae strains. In addition, the present C. brevispina aplanozygote specimens from Japan were assigned to C. krienitzii sp. nov., which was herein delineated on the basis of LM and electron microscopy and the molecular phylogeny of newly established strains.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is the most widely used index to characterize droughts that are related to precipitation deficiencies. However, the SPI does not always deliver the relevant information for hydrological drought management particularly in snow-influenced catchments. If precipitation is temporarily stored as snow, then there is a significant difference between meteorological and hydrological drought because the delayed release of melt water to the stream. We introduce an extension to the SPI, the Standardized Snow Melt and Rain Index (SMRI), that accounts for rain and snow melt deficits, which effectively influence streamflow. The SMRI can be derived without snow data, using temperature and precipitation to model snow. The value of the new index is illustrated for seven Swiss catchments with different degrees of snow influence. In particular for catchments with a larger component of snowmelt in runoff generation, the SMRI was found to be a worthwhile complementary index to the SPI to characterize streamflow droughts. Key Points SPI concept was expanded to account for temporary snow storage The SMRI improves description of hydrological drought in snow-dominated basins SMRI is adjustable and allows for regional comparisons},

Carotenoids and phenols-astaxanthin in snow-algae and purpurogallin in ice-algae-shield photosynthetic apparatus by absorbing over-abundant visible wavelengths, then dissipating the excess radiant energy as heat. This heat melts proximal ice crystals, providing liquid-water in a 0 degrees C environment and freeing-up nutrients bound in frozen water. We show that purple-colored particles transfer 87-89{\%} of solar energy absorbed by black particles. However, red-colored particles transfer nearly as much (85-87{\%}) by absorbing peak solar wavelengths and reflecting the visible wavelengths most absorbed by nearby ice and snow crystals; this latter process may reduce potential cellular overheating when snow insulates cells. Blue and green particles transfer only 80-82{\%} of black particle absorption. In the experiment, red-colored particles melted 87{\%} as much snow as black particles, while blue particles melted 77{\%}. Green-colored snow-algae naturally occupy saturated snow where water is non-limiting; red-colored snow-algae occupy drier, water-limited snow. In addition to increasing melt, we suggest esterified astaxanthin in snow-algae increases hydrophobicity to keep cells surficial.},

Recently, our comparative molecular analyses, using both field-collected and cultured materials, demonstrated that one Japanese lineage of “C. nivalis zygotes” belongs to C. miwae. Herein, we examined another Japanese lineage of field-collected “C. nivalis zygotes” and a new strain originating from Japan. Our molecular data demonstrated that these two different life cycle stages are conspecific, and that they represent a new species that we herein describe as C. muramotoi sp. nov., based on the vegetative and asexual morphological characteristics of the strain. Multigene phylogenetic analyses showed that this new species was sister to C. miwae. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the cysts of C. muramotoi are different from those of C. miwae, based on the arrangement of the flanges developing on the cell wall.},

abstract = {The quadriflagellate snow alga Chlainomonas Christen, distributed in New Zealand and North America, has several unusual structural attributes. A process assumed to be cytokinesis involves extrusion of protoplasm from the parent through a narrow canal, C. kolii (J. T. Hardy et Curl) Hoham produces a net-like outer envelope rather than a cell wall, and the flagellar basal apparatus of Chlainomonas consists of two semi-independent pairs of basal bodies. Structural connections between basal body pairs appear minimal, but a connecting system different from that observed in other genera exists within each pair. Phylogenetic analysis using rbcL sequences places Chlainomonas in the Chloromonas clade, other known members of which are all biflagellate. Chlainomonas is split into two robust lineages, with New Zealand collections sharing an origin with northern North American collections. Although the quadriflagellate condition is regarded as ancestral in the Chlorophyceae, we speculate, based on ultrastructural and molecular data presented here, that Chlainomonas represents a derived form that has arisen from fusion of two ancestral biflagellate cells. Other explanations (for example, that Chlainomonas represents a diploid form of a biflagellate species) are remotely possible but are presently at odds with extensive observations of field material. Improvements in techniques for experimental manipulation of these sensitive cryophiles will be required to fully characterize their structure and progress our understanding of their biology.},

abstract = {The Arctic is melting at an unprecedented rate and key drivers are changes in snow and ice albedo. Here we show that red snow, a common algal habitat blooming after the onset of melting, plays a crucial role in decreasing albedo. Our data reveal that red pigmented snow algae are cosmopolitan as well as independent of location-specific geochemical and mineralogical factors. The patterns for snow algal diversity, pigmentation and, consequently albedo, are ubiquitous across the Arctic and the reduction in albedo accelerates snow melt and increases the time and area of exposed bare ice. We estimated that the overall decrease in snow albedo by red pigmented snow algal blooms over the course of one melt season can be 13{\%}. This will invariably result in higher melt rates. We argue that such a ‘bio-albedo' effect has to be considered in climate models.},

abstract = {Snow algae are poly-extremophilic microalgae and important primary colonizers and producers on glaciers and snow fields. Depending on their pigmentation they cause green or red mass blooms during the melt season. This decreases surface albedo and thus further enhances snow and ice melting. Although the phenomenon of snow algal blooms has been known for a long time, large aspects of their physiology and ecology sill remain cryptic. This study provides the first in-depth and multi-omics investigation of two very striking adjacent green and red snow fields on a glacier in Svalbard. We have assessed the algal community composition of green and red snow including their associated microbiota, i.e., bacteria and archaea, their metabolic profiles (targeted and non-targeted metabolites) on the bulk and single-cell level, and assessed the feedbacks between the algae and their physico-chemical environment including liquid water content, pH, albedo, and nutrient availability. We demonstrate that green and red snow clearly vary in their physico-chemical environment, their microbial community composition and their metabolic profiles. For the algae this likely reflects both different stages of their life cycles and their adaptation strategies. Green snow represents a wet, carbon and nutrient rich environment and is dominated by the algae Microglena sp. with a metabolic profile that is characterized by key metabolites involved in growth and proliferation. In contrast, the dry and nutrient poor red snow habitat is colonized by various Chloromonas species with a high abundance of storage and reserve metabolites likely to face upcoming severe conditions. Combining a multitude of techniques we demonstrate the power of such complementary approaches in elucidating the function and ecology of extremophiles such as green and red snow algal blooms, which play crucial roles in glacial ecosystems.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. A lack of liquid water limits life on glaciers worldwide but specialized microbes still colonize these environments. These microbes reduce surface albedo, which, in turn, could lead to warming and enhanced glacier melt. Here we present results from a replicated, controlled field experiment to quantify the impact of microbes on snowmelt in red-snow communities. Addition of nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium fertilizer increased alga cell counts nearly fourfold, to levels similar to nitrogen-phosphorus-enriched lakes; water alone increased counts by half. The manipulated alga abundance explained a third of the observed variability in snowmelt. Using a normalized-difference spectral index we estimated alga abundance from satellite imagery and calculated microbial contribution to snowmelt on an icefield of 1,900 km2. The red-snow area extended over about 700 km2, and in this area we determined that microbial communities were responsible for 17{\%} of the total snowmelt there. Our results support hypotheses that snow-dwelling microbes increase glacier melt directly in a bio-geophysical feedback by lowering albedo and indirectly by exposing low-albedo glacier ice. Radiative forcing due to perennial populations of microbes may match that of non-living particulates at high latitudes. Their contribution to climate warming is likely to grow with increased melt and nutrient input.},

Two species of snow algae, Raphidonema nivale and Chloromonas pichinchae, were investigated for the effects that extracts from coniferous litter and different snow meltwaters would have upon their growth and development. The algae were collected from snow under coniferous trees near Mt. Stuart, Washington, and isolated into axenic cul- ture. Laboratory experiments indicated positive growth responses for C. pichinchae grown in extracts of coniferous leaves, bark, and pollen, and positive, neutral, and negative responses for R. nivale grown in extracts of leaves and bark. These results corre- sponded to observations made in the field where C. pichinchae was much more abundant than R. nivale in snowbanks located under coniferous-tree canopies. Neither species of snow algae responded to extracts from cone scales. Considerable morphological ab- normality occurred in cells of R. nivale grown in high concentrations of Pinus contorta bark extract. Indi- vidual cells showed ballooning effects, and cytologi- cal structures were atypical when compared to cells in normal filaments. Chloromonas pichinchae re- sponded differently to snow meltwater collected at three elevations near Mt. Stuart. The alga grew best in snow meltwater collected under a coniferous-tree canopy, and this sample contained the highest con- centration of inorganic P04-P. It was concluded that materials leached from dust and coniferous litter con- tribute to the chemical composition of snow and to the growth of snow algae.},

abstract = {Many species of microalgae have been used as source of nutrient rich food, feed and health promoting compounds. Among the commercially important microalgae, Haematococcus pluvialis is the richest source of natural astaxanthin which is considered as “super anti-oxidant". Natural astaxanthin produced by H. pluvialis has significantly greater antioxidant capacity than the synthetic one. Astaxanthin has important applications in the nutraceuticals, cosmetics, food, and aquaculture industries. Thanks to many researches it is now evident, that astaxanthin can significantly reduce free radicals and oxidative stress and help human body maintain a healthy state. With extraordinary potency and increase in demand, astaxanthin is one of the high-value microalgal products of the future. Thus, this comprehensive review summarizes the most important aspects of the biology, biochemical composition, biosynthesis and astaxanthin accumulation in the cells of H. pluvialis and its wide range of applications for humans and animals. In this paper, important and recent developments ranging from cultivation, harvest and postharvest bio-processing technologies to metabolic control and genetic engineering are reviewed in detail, focusing on biomass and astaxanthin production from this biotechnologically important microalga. Simultaneously, critical bottlenecks and major challenges in commercial scale production; current and prospective global market of H. pluvialis derived astaxanthin are also presented in a critical manner. A new biorefinery concept for H. pluvialis has been also suggested to guide towards economically sustainable approach for microalgae cultivation and processing. This report could serve as a useful guide to present current status of knowledge in the field and highlight key areas for future development of H. pluvialis astaxanthin technology and its large scale commercial implementation.},

abstract = {In four expeditions to the northwest coast of Spitsbergen (1995-1998) we have searched for yearly stationary snow algal fields and found them mostly near bird colonies on steep snow slopes. In this report, a hypothesis about the redispersion of snow algae on steep snow slopes typical for this coast region is given. Two points are of importance: first, motile cells are restricted to a small part of the snowfield near the drop edge on the top, and second, resting cells from previous year deep under the snow play a subordinate role. Resting cells dispersed onto snowfields located higher in the mountains are of special importance for next years algal blooming. In the early summer, meltwater streams concentrate cells of these fields in the upper part of the snow slope below the drop edge. Algal proliferation begins here and locally cell concentration can be very high (about {\textgreater}2 × 106 cells ml-1) and color the ice clumps deep green. The cell distribution in these wet snow/ice crystals is not uniform. Later in the season as the ground ice is exposed another bloom may form from the previous year's resting cells. Field samples of green, light yellow/red, and orange-red cells derived from the same location are analyzed by light and transmission electron microscopy.},

abstract = {Chloromonas is distinguished from Chlamydomonas primarily by the absence of pyre-noids, which are structures that are present in the chloroplasts of most algae and are composed primarily of the CO 2-{\textregistered}xing enzyme Rubisco. In this study we compared sequences of the rbcL (Rubisco large subunit-encoding) genes of pyrenoid-less Chlo-romonas species with those of closely related pyre-noid-containing Chlamydomonas species in th{\`{e}}`Chloromonasth{\`{e}}`Chloromonas lineage'' and with those of 45 other green algae. We found that the proteins encoded by the rbcL genes had a much higher level of amino acid substitution in members of the Chloromonas lineage than they did in other algae. This kind of elevated substitution rate was not observed, however, in the deduced proteins encoded by two other chloroplast genes that we analyzed: atpB and psaB. The rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions in the rbcL genes indicate that the rapid evolution of these genes in members of the Chloro-monas lineage is not due to relaxed selection (as it preasumably is in parasitic land plants). A phyloge-netic tree based on rbcL nucleotide sequences nested two Chlamydomonas species as a ``pyrenoid-re-gained'' clade within a monophyletic Chloromonas`` Chloromonas``pyrenoid-lost'' clade. Character-state optimization with this tree suggested that the loss and the regain of pyrenoids were accompanied by eight synapomorphic amino acid replacements in the Rubisco large sub-unit, four of which are positioned in the region involved in its dimerization. However, both the atpB and the psaB sequence data gave robust support for a rather dierent set of phylogenetic relationships in which neither th{\`{e}}`pyrenoid-lost'' nor th{\`{e}}`pyrenoid-regained'' clade was resolved. The appearance of such clades in the rbcL-based tree may be an artifact of convergent evolutionary changes that have occurred in a region of the large subunit that determines whether Rubisco molecules will aggregate to form a visible pyrenoid.},
annote = {-tl;dr: use multi-gene phylogeny!!
-no pyrenoid (containing mostly rubisco) in chloromonas
-hi mutation rate in rbcl
-hi rate of non-synonymous muts in rbcl (fewer in cell to pyrenoid loss, therefore less selection pressure?)
-significance: pairwise relative rate test 73{\%} chloromonas higher, vs 12{\%} significant of other
-rbcL indicates a pyrenoid-regained subclade (D), other two don't (hypohesized to be related to pres/abs of pyrenoid)
-they lie in the region that would bind rbc units together in a pyrenoid... so the still have a functional rubisco, but just relaxed selectoin on the part that joins them together to form pyrenoid

Both populations consisted mostly of smooth-walled quadriflagellates. They occurred in slush, and shared similar photosynthetic performances (photoinhibition above 1300 µmol photons m–2 s–1), very high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 64{\%} and 74{\%} respectively) and abundant astaxanthin accumulation, comparable to the red spores of Chlamydomonas nivalis (Bauer) Wille. Physiological differences between the Slovak and Austrian populations included higher levels of $\alpha$-tocopherol and a 13Z-isomer of astaxanthin in the former. High accumulation of secondary pigments in the Slovak population probably reflected harsher environmental conditions, since the collection was made later in the growing season w...},

abstract = {In Antarctica, mass accumulations of psychrophilic algae cause striking phenomena like green, orange, or red snow. This occurs during summer, when coastal snowfields start to melt, become waterlogged and photoautotrophs can thrive. Chloromonas polyptera (Fritsch) Hoham, Mullet {\&} Roemer is a unicellular species that causes orange snow in the vicinity of penguin rockeries. It has been recognized for many decades because of the distinct habitat and the characteristic morphology of cysts with elongated flanges on the outer cell wall. However, closer investigations concerning the ecology or physiology have been sparse so far. Field material was collected from two sites on the Antarctic Peninsula to find out more about metabolic and cellular strategies. The results were compared with a closely related species from high alpine locations, Chloromonas nivalis (Chodat) Hoham {\&} Mullet. Despite the geographical distance, C. polyptera shares several physiological strategies with the alpine relative, such as the formation of cyst stages, saccharose and glycerol as main soluble carbohydrates and the abundant accumulation of the carotenoid astaxanthin. Moreover, photosynthesis is adapted to temperatures of about 1°C. The molecular phylogeny confirmed a close relationship of C. polyptera to other Chloromonas species isolated from snow. Chloromonas polyptera seems to be exclusive to coastal Antarctic ecosystems influenced by animal nutrient input. {\textcopyright} 2013 Antarctic Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The majority of geomicrobiological research conducted on glacial systems to date has focused on glaciers that override primarily carbonate or granitic bedrock types, with little known of the processes that support microbial life in glacial systems overriding volcanic terrains (e.g., basalt or andesite). To better constrain the role of the supraglacial ecosystems in the carbon and nitrogen cycles, to gain insight into microbiome composition and function in alpine glacial systems overriding volcanic terrains, and to constrain potential elemental sequestration or release through weathering processes associated with snow algae communities, we examined the microbial community structure and primary productivity of snow algae communities on stratovolcanoes in the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest. Here, we present the first published values for carbon fixation rates of snow algae communities on glaciers in the Pacific Northwest. We observed varying levels of light‐dependent carbon fixation on supraglacial and periglacial snowfields at Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams, and North Sister. Recovery of abundant 18S rRNA transcripts affiliated with photoautotrophs and 16S rRNA transcripts affiliated with heterotrophic bacteria is consistent with previous studies indicating the majority of primary productivity on snow and ice can be attributed to photoautotrophs. In contrast to previous observations of glacial ecosystems, our geochemical, isotopic, and microcosm data suggest these assemblages are not limited by phosphorus or fixed nitrogen availability. Furthermore, our data indicate these snow algae communities actively sequester Fe, Mn, and P leached from minerals sourced from the local rocks. Our observations of light‐dependent primary productivity on snow are consistent with similar studies in polar ecosystems; however, our data may suggest that DIC may be a limiting nutrient in contrast to phosphorus or fixed nitrogen as has been observed in other glacial ecosystems. Our data underscore the need for similar studies on glacier surfaces and seasonal snowfields to better constrain the role of local bedrock and nutrient delivery on carbon fixation and biogeochemical cycling in these ecosystems.},

Why discrepancy between B-proteo and Sphingo? In our taxonomy is B-proteo a subset of Gamma and Sphingo a subset of Alpha? if this were ths case, there would still be a order discrepancy: we got {\^{}}{\^{}}actino, roughly equal A-proteo, maybe sphingo if we are mixed up on order/class. They got {\^{}}{\^{}}beta, the roughly = A-proteo, sphingo, actino.


I find their microcosm results less convincing than Ganey Dial

they cite P not N limited on glaciers.},

@article{Murali2018,
abstract = {Microbiome studies often involve sequencing a marker gene to identify the microorganisms in samples of interest. Sequence classification is a critical component of this process, whereby sequences are assigned to a reference taxonomy containing known sequence representatives of many microbial groups. Previous studies have shown that existing classification programs often assign sequences to reference groups even if they belong to novel taxonomic groups that are absent from the reference taxonomy. This high rate of “over classification” is particularly detrimental in microbiome studies because reference taxonomies are far from comprehensive. Here, we introduce IDTAXA, a novel approach to taxonomic classification that employs principles from machine learning to reduce over classification errors. Using multiple reference taxonomies, we demonstrate that IDTAXA has higher accuracy than popular classifiers such as BLAST, MAPSeq, QIIME, SINTAX, SPINGO, and the RDP Classifier. Similarly, IDTAXA yields far fewer over classifications on Illumina mock microbial community data when the expected taxa are absent from the training set. Furthermore, IDTAXA offers many practical advantages over other classifiers, such as maintaining low error rates across varying input sequence lengths and withholding classifications from input sequences composed of random nucleotides or repeats. IDTAXA's classifications may lead to different conclusions in microbiome studies because of the substantially reduced number of taxa that are incorrectly identified through over classification. Although misclassification error is relatively minor, we believe that many remaining misclassifications are likely caused by errors in the reference taxonomy. We describe how IDTAXA is able to identify many putative mislabeling errors in reference taxonomies, enabling training sets to be automatically corrected by eliminating spurious sequences. IDTAXA is part of the DECIPHER package for the R programming language, available through the Bioconductor repository or accessible online (

@article{Terashima2017,
abstract = {Psychrophilic algae blooms can be observed coloring the snow during the melt season in alpine snowfields. These algae are important primary producers on the snow surface environment, supporting the microbial community that coexists with algae, which includes heterotrophic bacteria and fungi. In this study, we analyzed the microbial community of green and red-colored snow containing algae from Mount Asahi, Japan. We found thatChloromonasspp. are the dominant algae in all samples analyzed, andChlamydomonasis the second-most abundant genus in the red snow. For the bacterial community profile, species belonging to the subphylumBetaproteobacteriawere frequently detected in both green and red snow, while members of the phylumBacteroideteswere also prominent in red snow. Furthermore, multiple independently obtained strains ofChloromonassp. from inoculates of red snow resulted in the growth ofBetaproteobacteriawith the alga and the presence of bacteria appears to support growth of the xenic algal cultures under laboratory conditions. The dominance ofBetaproteobacteriain algae-containing snow in combination with the detection ofChloromonassp. withBetaproteobacteriastrains suggest that these bacteria can utilize the available carbon source in algae-rich environments and may in turn promote algal growth.},

@article{Lozupone2005,
abstract = {We introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},
