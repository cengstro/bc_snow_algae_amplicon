Dear Dr. Head and Dr. Watanabe,

We would like to submit an original research article entitled "Alpine snow algae species composition along an elevational gradient" to be considered for publication in the ISME Journal. We believe this work represents a significant advance in snow algae ecology that will be of interest to your broad readership. 

Snow algae blooms are an important microbiome in earth's cryosphere, reducing albedo where blooms form on the snow surface. This study is the first to thoroughly document regional variation in snow algae blooms, and we report species composition can vary greatly from bloom to bloom. Our study reveals snow algae blooms are more diverse than previously thought, and contain different species at different elevations.

This manuscript is not being considered for publication elsewhere, and we declare no conflicts of interest. Our lab strives to set high standards of reproducibility and transparency; as such, all scripts and data are publicly available for other researchers.

We thank you for your consideration and look forward to your response.
