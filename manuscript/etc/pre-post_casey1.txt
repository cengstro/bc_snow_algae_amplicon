pre casey1:
1. chlainomonas over alpine lakes, monoculture
2. chloromonas krienitzii habitat not known, two life stages
  - is it ever the dominant species in a bloom?
3. mix of species
4. alpine and subalpine different morphologies
  - only 3 alpine snow algae communities metabarcoded





post casey1
1. chlainomonas everywhere in alpine, mixed in as well as monoculture
2. chloromonas krienitzii prevalent in well-lit runnels, green below orange
  - it can be the dominant species in a bloom
3. mix, or some relatively pure
4. alpine and subalpine different genetics
  - 33 alpine and subalpine communities

agreement: 
- sanguina often found with several species of chloromonas
- sanguina prevalent above treeline
- no green snow sanguina
- 

gap: while we know many of the species that form snow algae blooms, accurate species level identification is lacking, only one paper attempted to characterise 4 alpine snow algae communities using BLAST annotated 18s OTUs,
