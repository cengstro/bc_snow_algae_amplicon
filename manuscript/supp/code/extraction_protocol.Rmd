To extract DNA from the crushed cells we added 800 mL CTAB (Cold Springs Harbour Protocols), 1% B-mercaptoethanol, 5 $\mu$L each of proteinase K and RNAase A, and incubated these at 65 &deg;C for 30 minutes. We spun samples at 10,000 g for 3 minutes to pellet cell debris, then added 700 $\mu$L of supernatant to an equal volume of 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. We inverted samples to mix and centrifuged again at 12,000 g for 10 minutes. We precipitated DNA by transferring the top layer to 700 $\mu$L ice-cold ethanol, which we gently mixed, and spun over Qiagen DNA columns for 30 s at 15,000 g. We washed columns twice with 70% ethanol, and finally dissolved our DNA by spinning with 50 $\mu$L of sterile TE buffer.
