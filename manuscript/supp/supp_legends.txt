Figures
S1: Map of study sites locations.
S2: Base pair differences between GenBank snow algae sequence segments. A. 18S bp differences in primers used by Lutz et al 2016 and Terashima et al 2017. B. 18S bp differences between snow algae species using primers used in current study. C. Base pair differences between snow algae Genbank sequence segments, in the region amplified by our custom rbcL primers.
S3: Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of our rbcL ASVs (~400bp). Nodes annotated with bootstrap;bayesian scores, tips with best taxonomic annotation. Coloured circles on tips represent OTU, size proportional to total relative abundance.
S4: Cell count relative abundances of snow algae samples, with samples arranged on the x axis from lowest to highest elevation. Colors represent morphospecies. 
S5: 18S algae ASV clustering. These ASVs are a subset of all 18S ASVs, only including those assigned to Chlorophyceae. A. Multi-dimentional scaling (MDS) showing genetic distance between ASVs. Colored by taxonomic assignment, size proportional to relative abundance. B. t-SNE clustering of genetic distance between 18S. C. ML tree of 18S ASVs.
S6: rbcL diversity of snow algae samples, labelled by sample ID, plotted against date on the x axis, and coloured by elevation. Top: Faith's phylogenetic diversity, using phylogenetic tree in Fig. S3. Bottom: Shannon diversity.
S7: Relative abundance and microphotographs of samples from the same site. A: rbcL relative abundance of OTUs from May 22 green subsurface snow, and samples from July 4 with orange snow at surface and green snow below. B. Representative light microphotographs of cells from the same samples. 


Protocols
S1: DNA extaction protocol. 
S2: PCR conditions, including annealing temperatures and extension times. 


Tables
S1: Snow algae sample site data, only including samples that were included in metabarcoding.
S2: Primer table.
